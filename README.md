## Integrate weexpack commands


[Weexpack](https://github.com/weexteam/weex-pack) helps to setup weex application from scratch quickly. With simple commands, developers could create a Weex project, add different platform template, could install plugins from local, GitHub or Weex market, could pack up his application project and run on mobile. For those who would like to share his own plugins, he could publish them to the Weex market.

Now weex-toolkit can run the same commands of weexpack because of the new architecture. If your directory is generated by weexpack, you can build your iOS or android app.

### weex platform and run commands

Use `platform add|remove` to add or remove Weex app template and run it in your target devices.

``` bash
$ weex platform add ios
```

Then run platform, you will see an iPhone simulator

``` bash
$ weex run ios
```




### weex plugin commands

If you want to use some plugins on the [weex market] (https://market.weex-project.io/), weex-toolkit is the right choice.

```bash
$ weex plugin add plugin_name
```
You need to specify the plugin name from market like "weex-chart":

``` bash
$ weex plugin add weex-chart
```

Remove some plugins(eg:weex-chart):

``` bash
$ weex plugin remove weex-chart
```

## FAQ

#### #Environment
Please make sure your node version is above 6.0 and npm version is above 5.0.

#### #Current working directory is not a weexpack project
Since the 1.0.9 version, the `weex init` command has been removed. If you want to create the weex project, create it with the` weex create` command.

#### #Permisiion denied
First of all ,please do not install with "sudo" 
If `permisiion denied` error occurs,please try `sudo chmod 777 /usr/local/lib/node_modules`

If you see the following error

```
Error:permission denied.Please apply the write premission to the directory: "/Users/yourUserName"
```
We suggest you run `sudo chmod 777 ~` or `mkdir ~/.xtoolkit&chmod 777 .xtoolkit`

#### #Fsevents wanted error
windows users may have fsevents installation problems, like:
```
fsevents@1.1.2: wanted {"os":"darwin","arch":"any"} (current: {"os":"win32","arch":"ia32"})
```
You should remove your `node_module` of weex-toolkit, run command like this:

```
npm install --no-optional weex-toolkit -g

```
weex xbind repair toolkit-repair
weex repair
